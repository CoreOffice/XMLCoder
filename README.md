This package is a fork of the original
[ShawnMoore/XMLParsing](https://github.com/ShawnMoore/XMLParsing)
with more options and tests added.

## Example

```swift
import XMLCoder

let xmlStr = """
<note>
    <to>Bob</to>
    <from>Jane</from>
    <heading>Reminder</heading>
    <body>Don't forget to use XMLCoder!</body>
</note>
"""

struct Note: Codable {
    var to: String
    var from: String
    var heading: String
    var body: String
}

guard let data = xmlStr.data(using: .utf8) else { return }

let note = try? XMLDecoder().decode(Note.self, from: data)

let returnData = try? XMLEncoder().encode(note, withRootKey: "note")
```

## Installation

## Requirements

- Xcode 10
- Swift 4.2
- iOS 9.0 / watchOS 2.0 / tvOS 9.0 / macOS 10.10 or later

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

Navigate to the project directory and create `Podfile` with the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

Inside of your `Podfile`, specify the `XMLCoder` pod:

```ruby
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
# platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'YourApp' do
  # Comment the next line if you're not using Swift and don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for Test
  pod 'XMLCoder', '~> 0.3.1'

end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

Open the the `YourApp.xcworkspace` file that was created. This should be the
file you use everyday to create your app, instead of the `YourApp.xcodeproj`
file.

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

Carthage can be installed with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

Inside of your `Cartfile`, add GitHub path to `XMLCoder`:

```ogdl
github "MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder" ~> 0.3.1
```

Then, run the following command to build the framework:

```bash
$ carthage update
```

Drag the built framework into your Xcode project.

### Swift Package Manager

[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for
managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build
system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking
dependencies.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding `XMLCoder` as a dependency is as
easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder.git", from: "0.3.1")
]
```

## Contributing

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to xmlcoder@desiatov.com.

### Coding Style

This project uses [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat) to
enforce formatting style. We encourage you to run SwiftFormat within a local
clone of the repository in whatever way works best for you either manually or
automatically via an [Xcode
extension](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#xcode-source-editor-extension),
[build phase](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#xcode-build-phase) or
[git pre-commit
hook](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#git-pre-commit-hook) etc.
Please check [SwiftFormat
documentation](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#how-do-i-install-it)
for more details.

SwiftFormat also runs within our [Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.org/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder) setup and a CI build can fail
with incosistent formatting. We require CI builds to pass for any PR before
merging.

### Test Coverage

Our goal is to keep XMLCoder stable and to serialize any XML correctly according
to [XML 1.0 standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/). All of this
can be easily tested automatically and we're slowly improving [test coverage of
XMLCoder](https://codecov.io/gh/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder) and don't expect it to
decrease. PRs that decrease the test coverage have a much lower chance of being
merged. If you add any new features, please make sure to add tests, likewise for
changes and any refactoring in existing code.
