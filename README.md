This package is a fork of the original
[ShawnMoore/XMLParsing](https://github.com/ShawnMoore/XMLParsing)
with more features and improved test coverage.

## Example

```swift
import XMLCoder

let xmlStr = """
<note>
    <to>Bob</to>
    <from>Jane</from>
    <heading>Reminder</heading>
    <body>Don't forget to use XMLCoder!</body>
</note>
"""

struct Note: Codable {
    let to: String
    let from: String
    let heading: String
    let body: String
}

guard let data = xmlStr.data(using: .utf8) else { return }

let note = try? XMLDecoder().decode(Note.self, from: data)

let returnData = try? XMLEncoder().encode(note, withRootKey: "note")
```

## Advanced features

These features are available in [0.4.0
release](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/releases/tag/0.4.0) or later:

### Stripping namespace prefix

Sometimes you need to handle an XML namespace prefix, like in the XML below:

```xml
<h:table xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/">
  <h:tr>
    <h:td>Apples</h:td>
    <h:td>Bananas</h:td>
  </h:tr>
</h:table>
```

Stripping the prefix from element names is enabled with 
`shouldProcessNamespaces` property:

```swift
struct Table: Codable, Equatable {
    struct TR: Codable, Equatable {
        let td: [String]
    }

    let tr: [TR]
}


let decoder = XMLDecoder()

// Setting this property to `true` for the namespace prefix to be stripped
// during decoding so that key names could match.
decoder.shouldProcessNamespaces = true

let decoded = try decoder.decode(Table.self, from: xmlData)
```

### Dynamic node coding

XMLCoder provides two helper protocols that allow you to customize whether nodes
are encoded and decoded as attributes or elements: `DynamicNodeEncoding` and
`DynamicNodeDecoding`.

The declarations of the protocols are very simple:

```swift
protocol DynamicNodeEncoding: Encodable {
    static func nodeEncoding(for key: CodingKey) -> XMLEncoder.NodeEncoding
}

protocol DynamicNodeDecoding: Decodable {
    static func nodeDecoding(for key: CodingKey) -> XMLDecoder.NodeDecoding
}
```

The values returned by corresponding `static` functions look like this:

```swift
enum NodeDecoding {
    // decodes a value from an attribute
    case attribute

    // decodes a value from an element
    case element

    // the default, attempts to decode as an element first,
    // otherwise reads from an attribute
    case elementOrAttribute 
}

enum NodeEncoding {
    // encodes a value in an attribute
    case attribute

    // the default, encodes a value in an element
    case element

    // encodes a value in both attribute and element
    case both
}
```

Add conformance to an appropriate protocol for types you'd like to customize.
Accordingly, this example code:

```swift
struct Book: Codable, Equatable, DynamicNodeEncoding {
    let id: UInt
    let title: String
    let categories: [Category]

    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case id
        case title
        case categories = "category"
    }

    static func nodeEncoding(forKey key: CodingKey) 
    -> XMLEncoder.NodeEncoding {
        switch key {
        case Book.CodingKeys.id: return .both
        default: return .element
        }
    }
}
```

works for this XML:

```xml
<book id="123">
    <id>123</id>
    <title>Cat in the Hat</title>
    <category>Kids</category>
    <category>Wildlife</category>
</book>
```

### Coding key value intrinsic

Suppose that you need to decode an XML that looks similar to this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<foo id="123">456</foo>
```

By default you'd be able to decode `foo` as an element, but then it's not 
possible to decode the `id` attribute. `XMLCoder` handles certain `CodingKey`
values in a special way to allow proper coding for this XML. Just add a coding
key with `stringValue` that equals `"value"` or `""` (empty string). What
follows is an example type declaration that encodes the XML above, but special
handling of coding keys with those values works for both encoding and decoding.

```swift
struct Foo: Codable, DynamicNodeEncoding {
    let id: String
    let value: String

    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case id
        case value
        // case value = "" would also work
    }

    static func nodeEncoding(forKey key: CodingKey) 
    -> XMLEncoder.NodeEncoding {
        switch key {
        case CodingKeys.id:
            return .attribute
        default:
            return .element
        }
    }
}
```

### Preserving whitespaces in element content

By default whitespaces are trimmed in element content during decoding. This
includes string values decoded with [value intrinsic keys](#coding-key-value-intrinsic). 
Starting with [version 0.5](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/releases/tag/0.5.0) 
you can now set a property `trimValueWhitespaces` to `false` (the default value is `true`) on
`XMLDecoder` instance to preserve all whitespaces in decoded strings.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Xcode 10.0 or later
- Swift 4.2 or later
- iOS 9.0 / watchOS 2.0 / tvOS 9.0 / macOS 10.10 or later deployment targets

### Swift Package Manager

[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for
managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build
system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking
dependencies.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding `XMLCoder` as a dependency is as
easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder.git", from: "0.7.0")
]
```

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

Navigate to the project directory and create `Podfile` with the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

Inside of your `Podfile`, specify the `XMLCoder` pod:

```ruby
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
# platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'YourApp' do
  # Comment the next line if you're not using Swift and don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for Test
  pod 'XMLCoder', '~> 0.7.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

Open the the `YourApp.xcworkspace` file that was created. This should be the
file you use everyday to create your app, instead of the `YourApp.xcodeproj`
file.

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

Carthage can be installed with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

Inside of your `Cartfile`, add GitHub path to `XMLCoder`:

```ogdl
github "MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder" ~> 0.7.0
```

Then, run the following command to build the framework:

```bash
$ carthage update
```

Drag the built framework into your Xcode project.

## Contributing

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to xmlcoder@desiatov.com.

### Coding Style

This project uses [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat) to
enforce formatting style. We encourage you to run SwiftFormat within a local
clone of the repository in whatever way works best for you either manually or
automatically via an [Xcode
extension](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#xcode-source-editor-extension),
[build phase](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#xcode-build-phase) or
[git pre-commit
hook](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#git-pre-commit-hook) etc.
Please check [SwiftFormat
documentation](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#how-do-i-install-it)
for more details.

SwiftFormat also runs within our [Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.org/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder) setup and a CI build can fail
with incosistent formatting. We require CI builds to pass for any PR before
merging.

### Test Coverage

Our goal is to keep XMLCoder stable and to serialize any XML correctly according
to [XML 1.0 standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/). All of this
can be easily tested automatically and we're slowly improving [test coverage of
XMLCoder](https://codecov.io/gh/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder) and don't expect it to
decrease. PRs that decrease the test coverage have a much lower chance of being
merged. If you add any new features, please make sure to add tests, likewise for
changes and any refactoring in existing code.
