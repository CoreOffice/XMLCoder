This package is a fork of the original
[ShawnMoore/XMLParsing](https://github.com/ShawnMoore/XMLParsing)
with more features and improved test coverage.

## Example

```swift
import XMLCoder

let xmlStr = """
<note>
    <to>Bob</to>
    <from>Jane</from>
    <heading>Reminder</heading>
    <body>Don't forget to use XMLCoder!</body>
</note>
"""

struct Note: Codable {
    let to: String
    let from: String
    let heading: String
    let body: String
}

guard let data = xmlStr.data(using: .utf8) else { return }

let note = try? XMLDecoder().decode(Note.self, from: data)

let returnData = try? XMLEncoder().encode(note, withRootKey: "note")
```

## Advanced features

The following features are available in [0.4.0
release](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/releases/tag/0.4.0) or later
(unless stated otherwise):

### Stripping namespace prefix

Sometimes you need to handle an XML namespace prefix, like in the XML below:

```xml
<h:table xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/">
  <h:tr>
    <h:td>Apples</h:td>
    <h:td>Bananas</h:td>
  </h:tr>
</h:table>
```

Stripping the prefix from element names is enabled with
`shouldProcessNamespaces` property:

```swift
struct Table: Codable, Equatable {
    struct TR: Codable, Equatable {
        let td: [String]
    }

    let tr: [TR]
}


let decoder = XMLDecoder()

// Setting this property to `true` for the namespace prefix to be stripped
// during decoding so that key names could match.
decoder.shouldProcessNamespaces = true

let decoded = try decoder.decode(Table.self, from: xmlData)
```

### Dynamic node coding

XMLCoder provides two helper protocols that allow you to customize whether nodes
are encoded and decoded as attributes or elements: `DynamicNodeEncoding` and
`DynamicNodeDecoding`.

The declarations of the protocols are very simple:

```swift
protocol DynamicNodeEncoding: Encodable {
    static func nodeEncoding(for key: CodingKey) -> XMLEncoder.NodeEncoding
}

protocol DynamicNodeDecoding: Decodable {
    static func nodeDecoding(for key: CodingKey) -> XMLDecoder.NodeDecoding
}
```

The values returned by corresponding `static` functions look like this:

```swift
enum NodeDecoding {
    // decodes a value from an attribute
    case attribute

    // decodes a value from an element
    case element

    // the default, attempts to decode as an element first,
    // otherwise reads from an attribute
    case elementOrAttribute
}

enum NodeEncoding {
    // encodes a value in an attribute
    case attribute

    // the default, encodes a value in an element
    case element

    // encodes a value in both attribute and element
    case both
}
```

Add conformance to an appropriate protocol for types you'd like to customize.
Accordingly, this example code:

```swift
struct Book: Codable, Equatable, DynamicNodeEncoding {
    let id: UInt
    let title: String
    let categories: [Category]

    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case id
        case title
        case categories = "category"
    }

    static func nodeEncoding(for key: CodingKey) -> XMLEncoder.NodeEncoding {
        switch key {
        case Book.CodingKeys.id: return .both
        default: return .element
        }
    }
}
```

works for this XML:

```xml
<book id="123">
    <id>123</id>
    <title>Cat in the Hat</title>
    <category>Kids</category>
    <category>Wildlife</category>
</book>
```

Please refer to PR [\#70](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/pull/70) by
[@JoeMatt](https://github.com/JoeMatt) for more details.

### Coding key value intrinsic

Suppose that you need to decode an XML that looks similar to this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<foo id="123">456</foo>
```

By default you'd be able to decode `foo` as an element, but then it's not
possible to decode the `id` attribute. `XMLCoder` handles certain `CodingKey`
values in a special way to allow proper coding for this XML. Just add a coding
key with `stringValue` that equals `"value"` or `""` (empty string). What
follows is an example type declaration that encodes the XML above, but special
handling of coding keys with those values works for both encoding and decoding.

```swift
struct Foo: Codable, DynamicNodeEncoding {
    let id: String
    let value: String

    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case id
        case value
        // case value = "" would also work
    }

    static func nodeEncoding(forKey key: CodingKey)
    -> XMLEncoder.NodeEncoding {
        switch key {
        case CodingKeys.id:
            return .attribute
        default:
            return .element
        }
    }
}
```

Thanks to [@JoeMatt](https://github.com/JoeMatt) for implementing this in
in PR [\#73](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/pull/73).

### Preserving whitespaces in element content

By default whitespaces are trimmed in element content during decoding. This
includes string values decoded with [value intrinsic keys](#coding-key-value-intrinsic).
Starting with [version 0.5](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/releases/tag/0.5.0)
you can now set a property `trimValueWhitespaces` to `false` (the default value is `true`) on
`XMLDecoder` instance to preserve all whitespaces in decoded strings.

### Choice element coding

Starting with [version 0.8](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/releases/tag/0.8.0),
you can encode and decode `enum`s with associated values by conforming your
`CodingKey` type additionally to `XMLChoiceCodingKey`. This allows decoding
XML elements similar in structure to this example:

```xml
<container>
    <int>1</int>
    <string>two</string>
    <string>three</string>
    <int>4</int>
    <int>5</int>
</container>
```

To decode these elements you can use this type:

```swift
enum IntOrString: Equatable {
    case int(Int)
    case string(String)
}

extension IntOrString: Codable {
    enum CodingKeys: String, XMLChoiceCodingKey {
        case int
        case string
    }

    func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        switch self {
        case let .int(value):
            try container.encode(value, forKey: .int)
        case let .string(value):
            try container.encode(value, forKey: .string)
        }
    }

    init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        do {
            self = .int(try container.decode(Int.self, forKey: .int))
        } catch {
            self = .string(try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .string))
        }
    }
}
```

This is described in more details in PR [\#119](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/pull/119)
by [@jsbean](https://github.com/jsbean) and [@bwetherfield](https://github.com/bwetherfield).

### Integrating with [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine)

Starting with XMLCoder [version 0.9](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/releases/tag/0.9.0),
when Apple's Combine framework is available, `XMLDecoder` conforms to the
`TopLevelDecoder` protocol, which allows it to be used with the
`decode(type:decoder:)` operator:

```swift
import Combine
import Foundation
import XMLCoder

func fetchBook(from url: URL) -> AnyPublisher<Book, Error> {
    return URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher(for: url)
        .map(\.data)
        .decode(type: Book.self, decoder: XMLDecoder())
        .eraseToAnyPublisher()
}
```

This was implemented in PR [\#132](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/pull/132)
by [@sharplet](https://github.com/sharplet).

## Installation

### Requirements

**Apple Platforms**
- Xcode 10.0 or later
  * **IMPORTANT**: compiling XMLCoder with Xcode 11.2.0 (11B52) and 11.2.1 (11B500) is not recommended due to crashes with `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` caused by [a compiler bug](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-11564), please use Xcode 11.3 or later instead. Please refer to [\#150](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/issues/150) for more details.
- Swift 4.2 or later
- iOS 9.0 / watchOS 2.0 / tvOS 9.0 / macOS 10.10 or later deployment targets

**Linux**
- Ubuntu 14.04 or later
- Swift 5.0.1 or later

### Swift Package Manager

[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for
managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build
system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking
dependencies on all platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding `XMLCoder` as a dependency is as
easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder.git", from: "0.10.0")
]
```

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C
Cocoa projects for Apple's platfoms. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

Navigate to the project directory and create `Podfile` with the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

Inside of your `Podfile`, specify the `XMLCoder` pod:

```ruby
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
# platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'YourApp' do
  # Comment the next line if you're not using Swift or don't want
  # to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for YourApp
  pod 'XMLCoder', '~> 0.10.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

Open the the `YourApp.xcworkspace` file that was created. This should be the
file you use everyday to create your app, instead of the `YourApp.xcodeproj`
file.

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a dependency manager for Apple's
platfoms that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

Carthage can be installed with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

Inside of your `Cartfile`, add GitHub path to `XMLCoder`:

```ogdl
github "MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder" ~> 0.10.0
```

Then, run the following command to build the framework:

```bash
$ carthage update
```

Drag the built framework into your Xcode project.

## Contributing

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to xmlcoder@desiatov.com.

### Sponsorship

If this library saved you any amount of time or money, please consider [sponsoring
the work of its maintainers](https://github.com/sponsors/MaxDesiatov). While some of the
sponsorship tiers give you priority support or even consulting time, any amount is
appreciated and helps in maintaining the project.

### Coding Style

This project uses [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat) to
enforce formatting style. We encourage you to run SwiftFormat within a local
clone of the repository in whatever way works best for you either manually or
automatically via an [Xcode
extension](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#xcode-source-editor-extension),
[build phase](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#xcode-build-phase) or
[git pre-commit
hook](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#git-pre-commit-hook) etc.

To guarantee that these tools run before you commit your changes on macOS, you're encouraged
to run this once to set up the pre-commit hook:

```
brew bundle # installs SwiftLint, SwiftFormat and pre-commit
pre-commit install # installs pre-commit hook to run checks before you commit
```

Refer to [the pre-commit documentation page](https://pre-commit.com/) for more details
and installation instructions for other platforms.

SwiftFormat also runs on CI for every PR and thus a CI build can fail
with incosistent formatting. We require CI builds to pass for any PR before
merging.

### Test Coverage

Our goal is to keep XMLCoder stable and to serialize any XML correctly according
to [XML 1.0 standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/). All of this
can be easily tested automatically and we're slowly improving [test coverage of
XMLCoder](https://codecov.io/gh/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder) and don't expect it to
decrease. PRs that decrease the test coverage have a much lower chance of being
merged. If you add any new features, please make sure to add tests, likewise for
changes and any refactoring in existing code.
