# 0.8.0 (August 4, 2019)

This release adds support for decoding and encoding ordered sequences of
different elements as enums with associated values. In addition, XMLCoder now
supports Linux. Many thanks to [@jsbean](https://github.com/jsbean),
[@bwetherfield](https://github.com/bwetherfield) and
[@drewag](https://github.com/drewag) for implementing this!

**Breaking changes:**

- Fixed typo in `XMLDecoder` property: `errorContextLenght` has been renamed to `errorContextLength` in [\#114](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/pull/114).

**Closed issues:**

- XML with autoclosed tags [\#116](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/issues/116)
- Arrays of enums [\#91](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/issues/91)
- Array of enums with associated values [\#25](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/issues/25)

# 0.7.0 (July 2, 2019)

This release changes the behavior of attributes coding: now order of XML
attributes is fully preserved. One of the benefits is that it improves unit
testing for users of XMLCoder, which allows testing against specific encoded
attributes without accounting for their randomized order. Also a small coding
style fix is included. In addition, XMLCoder now uses Azure Pipelines instead of
Travis for CI with great improvements to overall CI stability, speed, and
parallel builds. Thanks to [AndrÃ©s Cecilia Luque](https://github.com/acecilia)
and [Jay Hickey](https://github.com/jayhickey) for the contributions!

# 0.6.0 (June 17, 2019)

An improvement release that introduces `convertFromKebabCase` and
`convertToKebabCase` key decoding strategies. There were a few changes that
aren't visible to end-users: the way that keys and values are stored internally
has changed and a few more tests added. Thanks to [AndrÃ©s Cecilia
Luque](https://github.com/acecilia) and [Vincent
Esche](https://github.com/regexident) for the contributions!

# 0.5.0 (May 2, 2019)

A small improvement release tagged early to resolve blocking issues in
[CoreXLSX](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/CoreXLSX). 

**Notable changes:**

* Empty value strings are no longer decoded as `nil` when a `String` is
  expected, but are decoded as empty strings, which represents the actual value.
* `trimValueWhitespaces` property was added on `XMLDecoder`, which allows
  overriding the default behaviour, where starting and trailing whitespaces are
  trimmed from string values.

**Closed issues:**

- Trimmed whitespace on decoding `String`

# 0.4.1 (April 12, 2019)

A bugfix release removing unused Xcode project scheme to improve build time
for Carthage users.

**Notable changes:**

* Remove unused scheme in Xcode project ([@MaxDesiatov](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov))

# 0.4.0 (April 8, 2019)

This is a release with plenty of new features that allow you to parse many more
XML variations than previously. Compatibility with Xcode 10.2 and Swift 5.0 is
also improved. A huge thank you to [@JoeMatt](https://github.com/JoeMatt) and
[@regexident](https://github.com/regexident) for their contributions, to
[@hodovani](https://github.com/hodovani) for maintaining the project, and to
[@Inukinator](https://github.com/Inukinator),
[@qmoya](https://github.com/qmoya), [@Ma-He](https://github.com/Ma-He),
[@khoogheem](https://github.com/khoogheem) and
[@thecb4](https://github.com/thecb4) for reporting issues during development!

**Notable changes:**

* Ordered encoding: this was one of the most requested changes and it's finally
  here! ðŸŽ‰ Now both keyed and unkeyed elements are encoded in the exactly same
  order that was used in original containers. This is applicable to both
  compiler-generated encoding implementations (just reorder properties or cases
  in your `CodingKeys` enum if you have it) and manually implemented `func
  encode(to: Encoder)`.
* Stripping namespace prefix: now if your coding key string values contain an
  XML namespace prefix (e.g. prefix `h` in `<h:td>Apples</h:td>`), you [can
  set](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/blob/3944866/README.md#stripping-namespace-prefix)
  `shouldProcessNamespaces` property to `true` on your `XMLDecoder` instance for
  the prefix to be stripped before decoding keys in your `Decodable` types.
* Previously it was possible to customize encoding with `NodeEncodingStrategy`,
  but no such type existed for decoding. A corresponding `NodeDecodingStrategy`
  type was added with `nodeDecodingStrategy` property on `XMLDecoder`.
* Thanks to the previous change, XMLCoder now provides two helper protocols that
  allow you to easily customize whether nodes are encoded and decoded as
  attributes or elements for conforming types: [`DynamicNodeEncoding` and
  `DynamicNodeDecoding`](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/blob/3944866/README.md#dynamic-node-coding).
* Previously if you needed to decode or encode an XML element with both
  attributes and values, this was impossible to do with XMLCoder. Now with the
  addition of [coding key value
  intrinsic](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/blob/3944866/README.md#coding-key-value-intrinsic),
  this is as easy as adding one coding key with a specific string raw value
  (`"value"` or empty string `""` if you already have an XML attribute named
  `"value"`).

**Closed issues:**

- Crash: Range invalid bounds in XMLStackParser.swift [\#83](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/issues/83)
- Document DynamicNodeEncoding and attributed intrinsic [\#80](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/issues/80)

# 0.3.1 (February 6, 2019)

A bugfix release that adds missing `CFBundleVersion` in generated framework's 
`Info.plist` ([#72](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/issues/72) reported by 
[@stonedauwg](https://github.com/stonedauwg)).

**Changes:**

* Set `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in project file ([#74](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/pull/74), [@MaxDesiatov](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov))

# 0.3.0 (January 22, 2019)

A maintenance release focused on fixing bugs, improving error reporting and
overall internal architecture of the library. For this release we've started
tracking test coverage and were able to increase it from 11.8% to 75.6%. ðŸŽ‰
Thanks to [@hodovani](https://github.com/hodovani) and
[@regexident](https://github.com/regexident) for their work on improving test
coverage in this release.

**Additions:**

You can now set `errorContextLength: UInt` property on `XMLDecoder` instance,
which will make it add a snippet of XML of at most this length from parser state
when a parsing error occurs. This change was provided by
[@hodovani](https://github.com/hodovani) and  can greatly help with attempts to
parse invalid XML, where previously only a line and column number were reported.

**Deprecations:**

`NodeEncodingStrategies` was renamed to `NodeEncodingStrategy` for consistency.
`NodeEncodingStrategies` is still available as a deprecated typealias, which
will be removed in future versions. Thanks to
[@regexident](https://github.com/regexident) for cleaning this up and providing
many more changes in this release that make `XMLCoder` better and easier to use.
